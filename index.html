          <h4>The Oath</h4>
          <p class="blue darken-1 m0">I swear to fulfill, to the best of my ability and judgment, this covenant:</p>
        </center>
      </nav>
    </div>
    <div class="container">
    <p class="card-panel">I will respect the hard-won scientific gains of those engineers in whose steps I walk, and gladly share such knowledge as is mine with those who are to follow.</p>

    <p class="card-panel">I will apply, for the benefit of the user and maintainer, all measures which are required, avoiding those twin traps of premature optimization and poor code coverage.</p>

    <p class="card-panel">I will remember that there is art to medicine as well as science, and that warmth, sympathy, and understanding may outweigh my own selfish need to defend code I hacked together hours before.</p>

    <p class="card-panel">I will not be ashamed to say "I know not," nor will I fail to call in my colleagues when the skills of another are needed for fixing a difficult bug.</p>

    <p class="card-panel">I will respect the privacy of my users, for their problems are not disclosed to me that the world may know. Most especially must I tread with care in matters of security, finance, and interpersonal matters. If it is given me to save a user from being compromised, all thanks. But it may also be within my power to hand over a user's information to authorities; this awesome responsibility must be faced with great humbleness and awareness of my own frailty. Above all, I must not play at God.</p>

    <p class="card-panel">I will remember that I do not treat a stack overflow, or a slow application, but a human being, whose broken software may affect the person's family and economic stability. My responsibility includes these related problems, if I am to care adequately for my users.

    <p class="card-panel">I will prevent bugs whenever I can, for prevention is preferable to fixing.</p>

    <p class="card-panel">I will remember that I remain a member of society, with special obligations to all my fellow human beings, those sound of mind and body as well as the infirm. Being a hacker does not mean I must be a jerk to anyone, nor to be insecure and weak.</p>

    <p class="card-panel">If I do not violate this oath, may I enjoy life and art, respected while I live and remembered with affection thereafter. May I always act so as to preserve the finest traditions of my calling and may I long experience the joy of creating, teaching, and fixing bugs for those who seek my help.</p>
